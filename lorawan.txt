LoRaWAN

Fact Sheet:
-Long range - multiple kilometers.
-Low power - can last years on a battery.
-Low cost - less than 20â‚¬ CAPEX per node, almost no OPEX.
-Low bandwidth - between 250bit/s and 11kbit/s in Europe using LoRa modulation (depending on the spreading factor)
-Coverage everywhere
-Secure - 128bit end-to-end encrypted

-media access control (MAC) protocol for wide area networks
-mapped to the second and third layer of the OSI model.
-implemented on top of LoRa or FSK modulation in industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands.
-operates in unlicensed radio spectrum.
-uses lower radio frequencies with a longer range.
-has official regional specifications, called Regional Parameters


---Uplink - data from node to Application
-Payload - encode as binary. Should be as small as possible.
-Interval - several minutes
-Data Rate - as fast as possible to minimize airtime - ?SF7BW125?
